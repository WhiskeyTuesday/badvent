# badvent

Some (probably bad) solutions to advent-of-code challenges in (potentially) various languages. Some of them are more spelled out and hopefully explain themselves and the thinking that went into them while some are maybe a bit more cryptic.

If the changes made between part 1 and part 2 are drastic I sometimes preserve the original part 1 solution in a block comment, if the changes are minor I usually don't.
